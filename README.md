I made this repo public and now I am obligated to put a README here, so...

# Compendium - The D&D 5e Tool Suite

## What is Compendium?

Compendium should hopefully turn out to be, at some point in the distant future, a comprehensive suite of utilities for operating campaigns and managing characters for virtual Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. The system will be primarily composed of three (maybe 4) elements:

## Compendium - the Discord Bot

A discord bot allowing for dice rolls, character management, battle management, world visualisation, complete homebrew item creation, and extensive documentation to boot to make the customisable experience as adaptable and fluid as possible.

## Compendium Creator - the Character Creator

An external software used for creating characters, synchronised via Discord's oAuth logins and allowing for creation of characters in accordance with custom rules, restrictions and content implemented by guild-associated campaigns.

## Compendium Constructor - the World Builder

A... currently unplanned concept, allowing you to (at some point) create the various maps any DM would need for running their campaigns and handling combat scenarios with accurate distance measurement and AoE effect management.

## Compendium Crafter - the Item Creator

An external software (probably built into Compendium Creator) that functions as an easy way to create homebrew content, ranging from Races and Backgrounds to Spells, Items, and everything in-between.

## End

I intend for Compendium, at some point, to be a free-to-use alternative to all current D&D5e solutions. A large majority of my inspiration stems from [Avrae](https://github.com/avrae/avrae) and [AuroraBuilder](https://github.com/aurorabuilder), however there are a few tweaks here and there I would like to make to create the most enjoyable experience as possible. Those two projects are amazing, and even though AuroraBuilder is now discontinued I highly suggest checking both out in the meanwhile if you intend on running your own campaign or if you just need to improve your already existing Dungeons & Dragons experience.

Oh, and all names of the previously mentioned projects are subject to change, of course.
