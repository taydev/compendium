# Compendium - Creation Suite Terms of Service

Compendium, either through the Discord Bot or through its Creation Suite, allows Users to create their own homebrew 
content for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition hosted through the Compendium platform, and to share their created content 
through the Compendium Content Browser so that other Users may use their created content within their own campaigns.
In these Terms, this content will be referred to as "User Content", and the services Compendium provides are referred to
as the "Platform".

In order for your contributed User Content to be available on the Compendium platform for these purposes, and to 
operate, market and promote the services provided by Compendium, the Platform requires the right to make use of such 
User Content in accordance with and subject to these Terms. Therefore, by contributing User Content to the Compendium 
platform or creating User Content on the Platform itself you automatically grant to the Platform a fully-paid and 
royalty-free license, by the Platform itself or by others within the Platform, to use, distribute, publicly display, 
republish, excerpt, translate, modify, revise and incorporate into campaigns, that User Content and any works derived 
from that User Content, in the manner in which the Platform permits User Content to be used, and to license or permit 
others to do so. This license also grants us the right to sublicense that User Content to other Users to permit their 
use of that User Content in the manner in which the Platform permits User Content to be used.

User Content uploaded to the platform must only contain content that would be considered acceptable to a global 
audience. Prohibited content includes but is not limited to nudity, gore, or sexually explicit images or videos, or 
anything deemed to be illegal or harmful such as child pornography. Content found to be in violation of these terms 
will be removed from the platform, and further action may be taken depending on the severity of the offense such as 
reporting the uploaded content to the Discord Trust and Safety team for further investigation.

You own all intellectual property in your own original User Content you contribute. You must not upload or contribute 
any Content not originally created by you, or any Content which is not properly licensed to you by someone else for 
uploading or contributing to the Platform. By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you accept all liability for any claims, 
demands, suits or proceedings made or brought against Compendium by a third party alleging that your User Content infringes or 
misappropriates such third party's intellectual property rights or violates any applicable laws. The Platform and its 
owner is also not liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential damages or any damages 
incurred by you, however caused or under any theory of liability. This includes, but is not limited to, lost profits or 
objects of monetary value (directly or indirectly), loss of data, or any other loss.
